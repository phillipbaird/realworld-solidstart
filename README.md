# RealWorld client made with Solid Start

An experiment in creating a [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app) client powered by [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com).

**Solid Start is in beta so this is very much a work in progress.**

## Developing

Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

Start a dev server with `pnpm dev`.

If for any reason you want to regenerate the api source from the OpenAPI definition then use `pnpm genapi`.
